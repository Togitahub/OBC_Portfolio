	"about_description": "I am 23 years old and I am from Costa Rica. I love God, soccer, technology, and programming. I am a bilingual junior full stack developer with an unusual perspective: before writing code, I managed teams, solved real-world technical failures, and optimized complex processes in industrial environments. Today, I apply that same logic, focus, and commitment to the world of software, creating clear, functional, and durable solutions. Not only do I learn quickly, but I also think differently and adapt to any situation. I am always learning new things and improving my skills as a developer so that I can bring a better version of myself to my future job every day.",
